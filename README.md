# What is a Data Chef?
There is a close similarity that can be observed between data science and art of cooking. Both involves the transformation of raw elements into an end result that cant be easily consumed.

Looking at data science from a chef's perspective, the original data is the raw ingredients that one has to work with. In most cases however, these ingredients in their raw form are unusable and need to be cleaned, sliced or prepared in some form, which is very similar to the pre-processing stage of data science to create usable data of high quality. While good data preparation is essential, it is also important to understand how the ingredients blend together.

Data scientists have an array of tools at their disposal, just like how chefs are equiped with different cooking methods and equipments. The key is knowing which tools to use in a particular situation, and not taking a one-size-fits-all approach. This comes with practice over time to build up the knowledge and experience in knowing how to use these tools efficiently, resulting in the creation of a product that will please the consumer.

The role of a data chef is therefore to work with raw data and turn it into consummable data insights to benefit a business.
